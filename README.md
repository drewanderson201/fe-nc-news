This project is the front end react application for News type application. It was built for the purpose of displaying the back end data and allowing the user to interact with that data such as posting a comment on an article, sorting articles based on some query. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world front end (such as Reddit) which consume the data coming from the back end architecture. It was created as part of the Northcoders software development bootcamp.
